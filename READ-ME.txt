Prerequisites

Before you continue, ensure you have met the following requirements:
•	Target Framework : .netcoreapp2.2
•	Visual Studio 2019



The application is on the Azure development environment website. Feel Free to click on the link
http://cupcakeshops.azurewebsites.net/


• In order to use the application at full capacity you should have an account.
• The app has a detail page for all the products but to view details of the products you are required to log in with an account.

• Photos on the menu page are chosen randomly from an inner class \(Cake). The only purpose for the photos on the main screen is for layout.
  I thought of adding IMG datatypes(byte) but it will increase the size of the application.

• For date-time I have used DateTimeOffset as a representation of instantaneous time.

Feel free to reach out if you are having difficulty with running the application.
